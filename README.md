cleansvg is a utility that can greatly reduce the size of SVG images.

Optimizations it can perform:

* Convert absolute path coordinates to relative coordinates.
* Reduce unneeded precision in coordinates.
* Convert path data to its most compact form.
* Replace CSS style attributes to SVG style attributes.
* Remove style attributes with default values.
* Remove metadata and namespaces added by WYSIWYG editors.
* Replace colors with their most compact representation.
* Create groups for adjacent elements with the same attributes.
